  abstract = {It is unclear whether sensory uncertainty during encoding increases susceptibility to interference or whether memories are relatively stable once information is encoded. These data provide evidence that while working memory representations are prone to adaptive distortions during delay periods, these distortions are not modulated by sensory noise during encoding.},

  of a working memory task presents a challenge to the storage of remembered information. 
  Here, we tested whether distracting stimuli influenced working memory while simultaneously 
  manipulating stimulus uncertainty during encoding to parametrically vary the strength of memory representations.},
