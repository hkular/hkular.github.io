PhD student in the Perception and Cognition Lab at UCSD Department of Psychology advised by John Serences. My research focus is visual working memory in humans. I apply statistical modeling to human behavioral data, utilize machine learning methods to analyze neuroimaging data, and test predictions of neural network models of working memory. I am interested in how and when working memory fails and the neural codes supporting the perception and storage in working memory.
