PhD candidate in the [Perception and Cognition Lab](https://serenceslab.ucsd.edu/) at University of California San Diego advised by Dr. John Serences. 

My research focus is visual working memory in humans. I apply statistical modeling to human behavioral data, utilize machine learning methods to analyze neuroimaging data, and test predictions of neural network models of working memory. I am interested in how and when working memory fails and the neural codes supporting perception and storage in working memory. 


Prior to starting my PhD, I worked as a research coordinator at the Vision and Perception Neuroscience Lab at Stanford University. There I worked on eyetracking and neuroimaging projects investigating the neural development of the visual system.
